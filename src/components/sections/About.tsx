        Hey, I&apos;m Kshitij, a full stack developer who loves building clean, modern websites and apps where design, functionality, and even the smallest details matter, with a focus on making products that are both practical and visually satisfying.

        Tech stack isn&apos;t my concern, I&apos;m flexible with whatever the project needs, though I prefer modern frameworks and tools. I&apos;m always open for new opportunities to learn and grow.
